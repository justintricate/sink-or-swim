# Sink or Swim

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster to date. In this webapp, we set out to use machine learning, and predict whether a user would have survived or perished.

* Front-end written in Python, using Streamlit.
* An exercise in machine learning and data modeling, using Jupyter Notebook.
* Uses scikit-learn's decision tree regressor model with a 90% certainty.


## FAQ

#### Q: Does it predict my chance of survival?

No, it simply determines whether one would live or perish, not odds of either.

#### Q: What are some of the most determining factors?

Sex appears to be the most driving factor, likely due to lifeboats being given to women and children first. (Over 75% of women live, with men under 20%.)
